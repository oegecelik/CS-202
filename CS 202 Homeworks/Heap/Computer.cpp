// The get key method for a computer prioritizes the time left to finish its current process, then secondly checks its index.
// The computer with the lowest time left and the lowest id has the highest priority, however the time and id should act independently.
// Hence, this getKey() method is implemented so that it returns (-timeLeft.id) as a decimal number. 
// Note that as time left decreases in absolute value, the returned number increases, therefore priority increases.
// Similarly, for any two computers with the same time left, as id decreases, the returned number increases, therefore priority increases.
